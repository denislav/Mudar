Chrome extension for autocorrection of wrong keyboard layout. Fixes the entered word in case the user forgot to switch from english to bulgarian input method or the other way around.


# Overview

The extension is trying to check every word that a browser user is typing and correct it if the entered word seems wrong. 
The "transliteration" occurs only if the entered word is not present in the language of origin but are present in the other language. The assumption is that words in latin are english words and words in cyrilic are bulgarian.

# Example

"koza" -> "коза" 

or 

"цлотх" -> "cloth"
